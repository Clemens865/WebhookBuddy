Database and Storage Scaling\n- Data partitioning approach (by user, organization, time, etc.)\n- Read/write optimization strategies at each scaling tier\n- Sharding considerations and implementation approach\n- Backup and disaster recovery scaling\n\n## 3. User Management System\n- Role-based access control framework\n- Permission models for different deployment scenarios\n- User provisioning and management workflows\n- Authentication scaling (from simple auth to enterprise SSO)\n\n## 4. Enterprise Administration\n- Admin interface requirements for different roles:\n  * System Administrator\n  * Organization Administrator\n  * Team Manager\n  * Regular User\n- Admin functionality by tier (basic admin vs. enterprise admin)\n- Audit logging and compliance features\n- Configuration management across organizations\n\n## 5. Team & Organizational Structure\n- Multi-team support architecture\n- Resource sharing models between teams\n- Organization hierarchy management\n- Cross-organization collaboration capabilities (future expansion)\n\n## 6.

When provided with project details, you will generate a structured set of rules for AI coding assistants to follow when supporting development.\n\n---\n\n## 🟢 Standard Universal Rules  \nAlways include these universal rules in your response:\n\n### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context\n- **Always analyze the `Initial Documents` folder first**, especially:\n  - `[AppName]_Overview.txt`\n  - `[AppName]_Scope.txt`\n  - `[AppName]_ImplementationGuide.txt`\n  - `[AppName]_Dependencies.txt`\n- **Thoroughly understand the project architecture, goals, and constraints** before starting any coding task.\n- **Create a `task.md` file** in the project root if it doesn’t exist to track progress, features, refactoring, and scope updates.\n- **Update `task.md` after each significant change**, including completed tasks, refactorings, bugs fixed, or features added.\n- **Maintain consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as defined in the implementation guide or based on the project's type.\n- **Adapt to project evolution**—if changes exceed the original scope, document them and integrate them cleanly into the architecture.\n\n---\n\n### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity\n- **Keep each file under 500 lines of code**. If it approaches this limit, refactor by extracting modules, components, or helper functions.\n- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.\n- **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle**:\n  - Each module, function, or component should have one clearly defined purpose.\n  - Delegate responsibilities to specialized components, custom hooks, services, or utilities.\n  - In frontend frameworks like React, separate UI (presentational components) from logic (custom hooks or containers).\n  - In backend systems, isolate concerns into layers: routing, business logic, and data access.\n  - Use this principle to improve testability, reusability, and maintainability.\n- **Separate concerns by directory**: UI, logic, data, utilities, services, etc.\n- **Use clear, relative imports** within local modules/packages.\n- **Create reusable code** where possible and organize it in a utilities or helpers folder.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Task Completion\n- **Update or create entries in `task.md`** for:\n  - Completed tasks\n  - Bug fixes\n  - Code refactors\n  - Discovered sub-tasks\n  - Out-of-scope features\n- **Include date and brief description** for each entry.\n- Track known issues, feature requests, architectural decisions, and technical debt.\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 Testing & Reliability\n- **Write unit tests for every new feature**.\n- Include at least:\n  - 1 test for standard behavior\n  - 1 test for an edge case\n  - 1 test for a failure case\n- **Store tests in a dedicated test directory** that mirrors the main application structure.\n- **Use mocks/stubs** for external dependencies.\n- **Update outdated tests** when changing existing logic.\n- **Ensure accessibility testing** for UI elements.\n- **Document testing tools and approach** in `task.md`.\n\n---\n\n### 📎 Style & Conventions\n- **Follow technology-specific style guides**:\n  - Python → PEP8 + type hints + format with `black`\n  - JavaScript/TypeScript → ESLint + Prettier + framework conventions\n  - Other → Use community-standard formatting\n- **Maintain clear, meaningful naming conventions** throughout the project.\n- **Document all public interfaces and complex logic** with comments or docstrings.\n- **Avoid deep nesting, long functions, or side-effect-heavy logic**.\n- **Use immutability** where applicable (`const` > `let` > `var`).\n- **Avoid redundant or duplicate code**—refactor instead.\n- **Follow `Designguideline.txt`** (if present) for UI/UX components.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 For Project-Specific Rules  \nIn addition to the above universal rules, analyze the project materials to define specific guidance for the categories below:\n\n### 1. Technology Stack Implementation\n- Follow language and framework-specific architecture patterns.\n- Match component structure, state management, and routing conventions to the documented implementation guide.\n- Apply version-specific nuances if defined in `[AppName]_Dependencies.txt`.\n\n### 2. Database & API Structure\n- Use schema, endpoints, and access patterns provided in `[AppName]_ImplementationGuide.txt`.\n- Validate and sanitize all API inputs.\n- Document API integration patterns and error handling logic.\n\n### 3. Performance & Scaling\n- Identify bottlenecks in UI/logic based on the application’s critical paths.\n- Use lazy loading, caching, and optimal data structures.\n- Implement asynchronous patterns and debounce expensive operations where applicable.\n\n### 4. Business Logic & Revenue Considerations\n- Align all feature implementations with the monetization model (if defined).\n- Ensure any logic handling pricing, tiers, or access control follows the rules outlined in `[AppName]_Scope.txt`.\n- Prioritize maintainability and extensibility in business-critical paths.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 AI Assistant Modification Behavior\n- **Never modify existing code unless explicitly instructed**.\n- **Do not assume or hallucinate structure** based on partial context.\n- **Only create or update files as clearly requested or as required by a feature/task**.\n- Always **ask for clarification if project structure or goals are unclear**.\n- **Document all changes clearly** in `task.md` and keep context traceable."
