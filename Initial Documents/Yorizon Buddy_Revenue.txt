# Yorizon Buddy: Revenue and Sales Strategy

## Executive Summary

Yorizon Buddy is positioned as a powerful Chrome extension targeting knowledge workers, researchers, and content creators who need efficient web data processing tools. Based on the project scope, MVP roadmap, and scaling strategy, we recommend a multi-tiered freemium pricing model with a clear path from individual users to enterprise deployment.

The strategy focuses on rapid initial adoption through free-tier functionality, a product-led growth approach for SMB customers, and a consultative enterprise sales model for larger organizations. This approach allows for organic growth while building a sustainable revenue stream that scales with the product's capabilities.

Key revenue projections:
- Year 1: $450,000 (primarily individual and team subscriptions)
- Year 2: $1.8M (expansion into mid-market with initial enterprise customers)
- Year 3: $4.5M (significant enterprise revenue growth with established SMB base)
