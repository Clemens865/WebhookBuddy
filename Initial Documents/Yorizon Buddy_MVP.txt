# Yorizon Buddy V1.2 - MVP Roadmap

## 1. MVP Strategic Overview

The core value proposition of Yorizon Buddy is to bridge web browsing with data processing workflows for knowledge workers. For the MVP, we'll focus on delivering a streamlined experience that enables users to:

1. Extract specific data from web pages
2. Use that data with AI agents through a conversational interface
3. Save and reuse effective prompts

By focusing on these three interconnected capabilities, we can deliver immediate value while laying the foundation for future expansion.

## 2. MVP Core Features

### Feature 1: Agent System with Page Content Integration
**Rationale:** This feature delivers immediate value by allowing users to interact with AI using web page content, which is the primary value proposition of the extension.

**Implementation Scope:**
- Simplified chat interface for interacting with OpenAI's models
- Ability to include current page content or selected text in prompts
- Basic conversation history within the current session
- API key configuration and storage

**Technical Complexity:** Medium - Requires OpenAI API integration, but can be implemented with focused scope.

### Feature 2: Basic Prompt Management
**Rationale:** Enables users to save effective prompts for reuse, drastically improving productivity over time while requiring minimal technical complexity.

**Implementation Scope:**
- Simple create/edit/delete functionality for prompt templates
- Basic categorization system (flat structure, not hierarchical)
- Simple template variable support
- List view of saved prompts with search functionality

**Technical Complexity:** Low - Primarily CRUD operations with local storage.

### Feature 3: Data Selection and Extraction
**Rationale:** Enables users to select specific data types from web pages, which is essential for focused AI interactions and future automation capabilities.

**Implementation Scope:**
- Page title, URL, and meta description extraction
- Selected text capture
- Basic content summarization option
- DOM element selection for specific content areas
- Simplified data preview before sending to agent

**Technical Complexity:** Medium - Requires content script implementation for DOM interaction.

### Feature 4: Chrome Side Panel Integration
**Rationale:** This is the foundation for the entire user experience and the deployment model for the extension.

**Implementation Scope:**
- Side panel activation and configuration
- Basic navigation between core features
- Responsive design for various panel widths
- Light/dark theme support based on browser settings

**Technical Complexity:** Low - Primary Chrome extension infrastructure requirement.

## 3. Deferred Features & Rationale

| Feature | Deferral Rationale | Planned for Phase |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Automation Flows & Webhooks** | Requires complex workflow engine and significant UI for configuration. The Agent System provides immediate value with less complexity. | Phase 2 |
| **Voice System** | Adds technical complexity with audio APIs and requires transcription services. Not essential for demonstrating core value. | Phase 3 |
| **Hierarchical Categories** | Flat categories are sufficient for MVP. Complex hierarchy adds UI and data modeling complexity. | Phase 2 |
| **Import/Export Functionality** | Not critical for initial users with small prompt libraries. | Phase 2 |
| **Advanced User Profile** | Basic settings are integrated into features. Comprehensive profile management is not essential for core functionality. | Phase 2 |
| **Rich Text Prompt Editor** | Plain text is sufficient for MVP. Rich text adds complexity with minimal initial value. | Phase 2 |
| **Agent Configuration** | MVP will focus on OpenAI integration. Multiple agent types and configurations can be added later. | Phase 2 |

## 4. Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation & Architecture
- Set up Chrome extension project with Side Panel API integration
- Implement basic navigation and UI framework
- Establish storage architecture with Chrome Storage API
- Create security utilities for API key handling

### Weeks 2-3: Core Feature Development
- Implement Agent System with OpenAI integration
- Develop basic Prompt Management functionality
- Create Data Selection and Extraction utilities
- Implement content script for web page interaction

### Week 4: Integration & Refinement
- Connect all components into cohesive workflow
- Implement light/dark theme support
- Add error handling and basic feedback mechanisms
- Optimize performance for large web pages

### Week 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Conduct usability testing with target users
- Fix critical issues and refine user experience
- Implement security review and improvements
- Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission

## 5. MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. Users can extract relevant content from web pages using at least 3 different selection methods
2. Users can create, save, and reuse at least 15 different prompt templates
3. Users can engage in AI conversations incorporating web page content with <2 second response initiation
4. The extension maintains stable performance across 10+ popular websites without crashes or memory issues
5. First-time users can successfully complete a full workflow (select content → use with AI → save prompt) in under 3 minutes

## 6. Minimum Technical Stack for MVP

### Frontend
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling with theme support
- React Router for navigation
- Context API for state management (deferring Redux complexity)

### API & Integration
- Axios for HTTP requests
- OpenAI client library

### Storage
- Chrome Storage API (deferring IndexedDB for MVP)
- Basic encryption for API keys

### Development
- Webpack for bundling
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Basic Jest testing for critical utilities

## 7. Key Technical Considerations

1. **Security Focus:** Implement proper encryption for API keys from day one to establish security practices early.

2. **Performance Optimization:** Large web pages can cause performance issues when extracting content. Implement progressive loading and processing to maintain responsiveness.

3. **Error Handling:** OpenAI API may have rate limits or downtime. Implement robust error handling with clear user feedback.

4. **Storage Limitations:** Chrome Storage has size limitations. Design data models with size efficiency in mind, particularly for conversation history.

5. **Browser Compatibility:** Focus on Chrome for MVP, but design architecture to support potential expansion to other Chromium browsers.

## 8. Roadmap to Full Product

### Phase 2: Enhanced Productivity (8 weeks post-MVP)
- Automation Flows with Webhook integration
- Advanced Prompt Management with hierarchical categories
- Import/Export functionality for prompts
- Enhanced Agent Configuration with multiple providers
- User profile and advanced settings

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (12 weeks post-Phase 2)
- Voice Recording and processing system
- Rich Text Editing for prompts with media support
- Advanced automation with conditional logic
- Team sharing capabilities
- Analytics and usage insights

### Phase 4: Enterprise Readiness (16 weeks post-Phase 3)
- Advanced security features
- Team management and permissions
- Integration with enterprise systems
- Custom deployment options
- Advanced customization capabilities

## 9. Conclusion

This MVP roadmap focuses on delivering a tightly integrated core experience that demonstrates the key value proposition of Yorizon Buddy while being achievable within a 5-week timeframe. By prioritizing the Agent System, Prompt Management, and Data Selection capabilities, we deliver immediate value to users while establishing the foundation for future expansion.

The plan deliberately defers complex features like automation workflows and voice recording to focus on a smooth, reliable core experience. This approach allows for rapid market validation and user feedback before investing in more complex capabilities.
